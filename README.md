# TailPass
Tailpass is a Tailscale powered TCP port forwarding tool that bridges your VLANs, containers, and hosts  simply and securely.
You can easily connect web servers, SSH sessions, databases, or any TCP service across your network without worrying about complex configurations.
Add your local and remote services, start the tunnel, and your traffic flows seamlessly through Tailscale. Tailpass gives you a lightweight dashboard, an efficient backend, and the freedom to access your services from anywhere.

# Running TailPass with Docker Compose
TailPass consists of:
* Backend (Go) – Handles API requests and port forwarding
* Frontend (Vue.js) – Web interface for configuration and monitoring
* PostgreSQL Database – Stores tunnel and service data

All components are containerized and managed with Docker Compose.

# 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mascarenhasmelson/TailPass.git
cd TailPass
```
# 2. Build and Run the Containers

```
docker compose up --build
```

# 3. Access the Services

| Service  | URL                  | Description                          |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | http://localhost:8000 | TailPass Web GUI                     |
| Backend   | http://localhost:8082 | Go API Server                        |
| Database  | localhost:5432        | PostgreSQL (admin / StrongPassword123) |

## Usage

TailPass allows you to forward TCP ports from your local machine, container, or VLAN network through your Tailscale interface — enabling secure remote access to any TCP service such as web servers, SSH, or databases.

You can bind the service to any **local IP address**, including:
- `127.0.0.1` → to expose only on localhost  
- `100.x.x.x` (Tailscale IP) → to expose over your Tailscale network  
- `0.0.0.0` → to listen on all available interfaces  

Added `.env` file for runtime, these are the default parameters
```
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=StrongPassword123
POSTGRES_DB=tunnel_services
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8082
```
